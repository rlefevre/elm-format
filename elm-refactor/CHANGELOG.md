## upgrade-tool

- there's now usage info `elm-refactor --help`

- variables and types that are references via `exposing (..)` will now be upgraded
- preferred `exposing` clauses in the imports of the upgrade definition will now be applied when possible


## alpha-59-g62e3772

- upgrade scripts now must fully qualify references to custom type variants from deprecated modules
- import aliases in the source modules are applied to the upgraded code
- substitutions using `<|` are now simplified the same as when using parens
- simplification of case expressions is smarter about knowing when it can simplify (for example, when there is a wildcard branch but earlier branches are guaranteed to never match)

- lets you define upgrade definitions for constructor tags (`upgrade_Module_SomeCapitalizedTagName = ...`)
